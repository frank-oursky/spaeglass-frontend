                <h4>Mapping Out Your Cashflow</h4>

                <p>Spaeglass maps out your cashflows from lifestyle. 
It does this by asking questions about your income, age, spending, financial goals and plotting an estimated schedule of the cashflow of these 
things over your life.</p>

                <h4>Setting Up a Simulation</h4>

                <p>Spaeglass takes information on your investments to set up a simulation on how those investments could possibly perform over your lifetime.</p>

                <h4>Simulating Statistics</h4>

                <p>Spaeglass will then combine these two things to 
see your cashflow from lifestyle does against various simulations of your investments over time, and reports back some of the statistics to you.</p>

               <h5>Percent Chance of Insolvency</h5>
               <p>Your combined lifestyle and investment cashflows are simulated thousands of 
times. The percentage of those simulations in which you run out of cash is interpreted as your Percent Chance of Insolvency. You can read that as, if you continue to live, work, and invest according to your inputs, you have an X% chance of running out of cash in your lifetime.</p>

                 <h5>Maximum Loss</h5>
                 <p>This is the heaviest loss in net investments that occurred in your simulation. This will likely be a very unusual event, but is not outside the realm of possibilities. It should be a number you are able to emotionally tolerate.</p>

                 <h5>Average Net Worth</h5>
                 <p>You can see what your average net worth would be for various lifestyle and investment combinations.</p>

                  <p>Presumably, you are trying to maximise your Average Net Worth while making sure your Percent Chance of Insolvency and Maximum Loss are acceptable. </p>
